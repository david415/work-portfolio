<p><strong>tl,dr; curriculum vitae/résumé available upon request</strong></p>
<p>I am an independent security researcher, public speaker and software
developer.  If you are reading this website it is likely that you are
looking for a Golang or Rust software developer, software architect,
or chief technical officer. You are in the right place.</p>
<p>I started my career as a network tools developer and operations
engineer. I worked for Internet service providers and software
companies, automating systems and network operations. The banality of
DevOps no longer interested me and shortly after the Edward Snowden
document leaks I transitioned my career into more of a software development
role and took a keen interest in computer security, especially
cryptography and anonymous communication networks.</p>
<p>I did a lot of public speaking while working on the Katzenpost mix network project.
If you are researching my background I suggest you watch one of these videos to get
a sense for how I present complex technical topics.</p>
<p>The work presented in this portfolio has everything to do with my
personal interests and basically nothing to do with the proprietary
software I&rsquo;ve written for commercial companies. Therefore there are
certain aspects of my experience that are not emphasized herein.  This
is but a small sample of my work experience. To understand more fully
my work experience and history you should ask me for a copy of my curriculum
vitae/résumé.</p>
