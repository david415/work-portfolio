<h3>Rust</h3>
<img src="/images/rustacean-orig-noshadow_rlysm.png" alt="rustacean logo" align="left">
<p>I learned Rust by writing cryptography libraries and solving <strong>cryptopals</strong> challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/david415/cryptopals">My solutions to some of the cryptopals challenges</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So firstly, let me just state that I didn&rsquo;t solve all of the
challenges yet. I did most of the first two sets.  My process for
learning Rust at the same time was to first solve the challenge in
Golang and then port my solution to Rust.  I&rsquo;ve written my solution in
the form of a library (crate), and then each challenge is represented
as an integration test case which tests the library&rsquo;s code.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sphinx-cryptography/mix_link">Noise based cryptographic network protocol for mixnets</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At the very least this project gives you an example of how to compose
a <a href="https://noiseprotocol.org/">Noise</a> cryptographic transport
protocol.  Mix Link uses the Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2b
handshake. Rekeying is done after every message that is sent. Messages
are serialized using a custome minimal binary format. The message
types are useful for building a message oriented anonymous
communication network called a &ldquo;mix network&rdquo; but they could be
modified to write other types of distributed systems.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sphinx-cryptography/aez">Rust ffi bindings to AEZ written in C</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here I wrote some C FFI bindings around the reference implementation of the AEZ wide-block cipher.
Soon afte I wrote this, someone came along and made some improvements. :)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sphinx-cryptography/rust-sphinxcrypto">Sphinx cryptographic packet format</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sphinx is cryptographic packet for design to implement anonymous communication networks such
as decryption mix networks and Hornet/Lightening network. This implementation is design to be
compatible with <a href="https://github.com/katzenpost">Katzenpost</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sphinx-cryptography/rust-lioness">Lioness wide block cipher</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote this Lioness implementation specifically to be binary compatible with
<a href="https://github.com/david415/lioness">my golang Lioness implementation</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sphinx-cryptography/ecdh_wrapper">ECDH wrapper</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sphinx-cryptography/sphinx_replay_cache">Reply Cache for Sphinx packets</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sphinx-cryptography/mix_server">Mix Server</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a work-in-progress mix server meant to implement a SEDA
(staged events drive architecture) pipeline for packet processing.</p>
<h3>Golang</h3>
<p>I started writing Go back in 2014.</p>
<img src="/images/gopherbw.png" alt="golang gopher image" align="left">
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/katzenpost">Katzenpost</a></li>
</ul>
<p>From 2017 to around 2020 I&rsquo;ve worked on an anonymous communication
network, specifically a decryption mix network known as
Katzenpost. This open source software project started off as part of
the Horizon 2020 Panoramix Project funded by the European Commision
and included collaborations with some of the top European computer
science researchers. The design of Katzenpost was largely based off of
<a href="https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/loopix2017.pdf">The Loopix Anonymity System</a>
which was published at 2017 Usenix Security and Privacy conference.</p>
<p>This project included 3 months of collaborations with European
academics to write our design specification documents
followed by several months of software development time. Katzenpost
has also received grant funding from Samsung and NLNet.</p>
<p><a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/katzenpost/index.html">See NLnet accouncement</a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/david415/honeybadger">Passive TCP injection attack detector ``Honeybadger''</a> and <a href="https://honeybadger.readthedocs.org/">docs</a></li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/honeybadger.png" alt="honeybadger image" align="left">
<p>In 2014, shortly after the Edward Snowden document leaks I wrote
Honeybadger, the most advanced detector of TCP injection
attacks. Honeybadger uses my own classification of injection attacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>handshake hijack</li>
<li>segment veto</li>
<li>sloppy injection</li>
<li>out-of-order coalesce injection</li>
<li>censorship injection</li>
</ol>
<p>To read about my TCP injection classification see: <a href="https://github.com/david415/HoneyBadger_docs/blob/master/source/how-to-detect-TCP-injection-attacks.rst#tcp-injection-attack-categories">TCP injection attack categories</a></p>
<p>During my work on Honeybadger I have also acted as an advisor for
Google in the improvement of their Gopacket library.  In particular I
was coresponding with Graeme Connell with Google and Laurent
Hausermann with Sentryo in April of 2015. NOTE: I have never been
employed by Google; I am an independent security researcher.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/google/gopacket/blob/master/bsdbpf/bsd_bpf_sniffer.go">BPF Sniffer API for Google&rsquo;s gopacket library</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I added the BSD BPF sniffer to Google&rsquo;s gopacket library as part of
the previously mentioned Honeybadger software project. I did this so
that Honeybadger could be efficiently used on BSD operating systems
such as FreeBSD without having to use libpcap. Might as well have Google
maintain the code for me, am I right? :)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/subgraph/roflcoptor">Roflcoptor, Tor control port filter daemon for the Subgraph OS project</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote the most sophisticated Tor control port filter daemon. The Tor
control port allows applications to control the Tor daemon and perform
various operations such as create an onion service or create a Tor
circuit. With Roflcoptor acting as a proxy to the Tor control port,
each application has a white list of Tor control port
commands. This greatly reduces the risk of deanonymization when giving
an application access to the Tor control port. (see <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/control-spec.txt">Tor control port specification</a> )</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16681">Fixed a bug in the syscall module of the Go standard library</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/OpenBazaar/go-onion-transport">Wrote the IPFS Tor Onion transport</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/david415/ParasiticTraceroute">Parasitic TCP traceroute tool</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My Parasitic TCP traceroute tool makes use of the Linux kernel&rsquo;s
nfqueue subsystem to mangle TCP packets of an existing connection in
order to perform a traceroute. Such a traceroute might in some
circumstances be useful for tracing a connection beyond an upstream NAT
(network address translation) device.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Yawning/bulb">Contributed some code to Bulb, for the onion listener</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Bulb is useful for Tor integration and this feature I added allows for
Go applications to easily create a Tor onion service.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/subgraph/fw-daemon">Added SOCKS5 proxy to Subgraph OS Firewall daemon</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/subgraph/go-nfnetlink/issues/1">Reported a subtle bug in Subgraph&rsquo;s Linux netfilter queue library</a></p>

<h3>Python</h3>
<img src="/images/110px-Python-logo-notext.svg.png" alt="python logo" align="left">

<BR>
<BR>
<p>  Most of my Python experience involves async IO networking with
Twisted, however, I&rsquo;ve also used Tornado and blocking IO. Many of my
Python project involve networking and cryptography; this is after all,
the main theme repeated throughout my work portfolio.</p>
<BR>
<ul>
<li>Contributed various feature additions to the <a href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/">Tahoe-LAFS project</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tahoe-LAFS is an encrypted file store with a powerful cryptographic capability system.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/applied-mixnetworks/sphinxmixcrypto">Forked Ian Goldberg&rsquo;s reference implementation of the Sphinx cryptographic packet format</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I made the Sphinx cryptographic packet library compatible with Python
2 and Python 3. I&rsquo;ve also upgraded some of the cryptographic
primitives.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/david415/pylioness">Wrote a Lioness wide block cipher library</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Lioness is an SPRP - a super pseuodo random permutation which is also
known as a wide-block cipher. It&rsquo;s useful in circumstances where you
can authenticated the plaintext but not the ciphertext.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/david415/scan_tor_rfc5961">Wrote a active network scanner for a Linux kernel vulnerability that affected the Tor network</a> and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2016-December/001105.html">sent a report to the tor-dev mailing list</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I came up with a Tor guard discovery attack involving this Linux
kernel vulnerability however my analysis remains unpublished due to
ethical considerations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/david415/tor_partition_scanner">Wrote a Tor network partition detection scanner</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon">Made various contributions to txtorcon</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/pycryptopp">Assisted with pycryptopp maintenance releases</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/warner/foolscap">Assisted with Tor integration for Foolscap</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/david415/twistedcat">Wrote a socat-like tool using Twisted</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/david415/onionvpn">Wrote a Tor onion transport VPN</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is essentially a VPN which uses Tor onions as the network transport.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/david415/txtorhttpproxy">Wrote Twisted http to tor proxy</a></li>
</ul>
