      <description>These talks primarily took place in various areas of Europe where I talked about mix networks, a kind of anonymous communication network.
My goal in these talks is to make some complex topics understandable to a non-technical audience and to advocate for privacy enhancing technology, especially anonymous communication networks. I believe that people&amp;rsquo;s untrained mathematical intuition is enough of a prerequisite for understanding deeply technical and complex topics involving cryptography and probability theory.</description>
