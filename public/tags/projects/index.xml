      <description>The following specified projects are a small sample of my open source contributions and is not by any means an exhaustive list of the software projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on. I have for instance, contributed to various proprietary software projects which of course will not be mentioned here.
Below you will find the repeated theme of networking and cryptography. Of course I know about high performance computing, databases, data transformations, systems programming etc.</description>
