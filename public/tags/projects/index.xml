      <description>David Stainton&amp;rsquo;s open source and free software projects:
The following specified projects are a small sample of my open source contributions and is not by any means an exhaustive list of the software projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on. I have for instance, contributed to various proprietary software projects which of course will not be mentioned here.
Below you will find the repeated theme of networking and cryptography. Of course I know how to load information from databases, transform data, etc.</description>
