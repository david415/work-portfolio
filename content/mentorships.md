<h2>Mentorships</h2>

* In 2017 I mentored Katharina Kohls from Bochum University (Germany)
  in the use of Tor and [txtorcon](https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon)
  to make customized Tor circuits for her Tor research project. Katharina's
  work can be found here: https://www.infsec.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/lehrstuhl/mitarbeiter/kohls/

* In 2020 I mentored Denis Varlakov from Tomsk State University
  (Siberia) in writing a comprehensive TCP injection detector which
  was directly inspired by my work on [Honeybadger](https://github.com/david415/honeybadger).
  Denis's software is written in Rust and can be found here: https://github.com/survived/detect-inj
