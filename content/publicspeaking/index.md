These talks primarily took place in various areas
of Europe where I talked about mix networks, a kind of anonymous
communication network.

My goal in these talks is to make some complex topics understandable
to a non-technical audience and to advocate for privacy enhancing
technology, especially anonymous communication networks.
I believe that people's untrained mathematical intuition is enough
of a prerequisite for understanding deeply technical and complex
topics involving cryptography and probability theory.

I've also self-published a few youtube videos for explaining specific topics related to mix networks:
