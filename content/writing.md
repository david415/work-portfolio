<h2>Writing</h2>

* [My Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yM_b0nIAAAAJ&hl=en)

* Least Authority's Blog: [Introduction to Mix Networks and Anonymous Communication Networks](https://leastauthority.com/blog/mixnet-intro/)

LeastAuthority TFA GmbH published this blog post I wrote as an introduction to mix networks and anonymous communication.

* [Katzenpost Mix Network Design Specifications](https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/tree/master/specs)

These [Katzenpost](https://katzenpost.mixnetworks.org/) mix network
design specification documents are the direct result of a three month
collaboration with Yawning Angel, George Danezis, Claudia Diaz, Ania
Piotrowska and myself. We did this work as part of the H2020 EU
project [Panoramix](https://panoramix-project.eu/) (Privacy and Accountability in Networks via
Optimized Randomized Mix-nets).

* [Mix Network Syllabus](https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/mixnet_academy/syllabus.rst)

I put together a list of papers to read in order to gain a deeper understanding of mix networks.


* [Mix Network bibliography](https://bib.mixnetworks.org/) and [Mix Bib source code](https://github.com/applied-mixnetworks/mixbib)

I was one of the founders of the Mix Network Bibliography.

* [How to detect TCP injection attacks](https://github.com/david415/HoneyBadger_docs/blob/master/source/how-to-detect-TCP-injection-attacks.rst)

In 2014-2015 shortly after the Edward Snowden document leaks I
conducted research into TCP injection attacks. This document expounds
upon my comprehensive classification of TCP injection attacks and is a
result of my work on
[Honeybadger](https://github.com/david415/honeybadger) which is known
as the most sophisticated TCP injection attack detection tool.
