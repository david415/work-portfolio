* [Katzenpost Mix Network Design Specifications](https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/tree/master/specs)

These Katzenpost mix network design specification documents are the direct result of a three month collaboration with Yawning Angel, George Danezis, Claudia Diaz, Ania Piotrowska and myself. We did this work as part of the H2020 EU project Panoramix (Privacy and Accountability in Networks via Optimized Randomized Mix-nets).

LeastAuthority published this blog post I wrote as an introduction to mix networks.

I was one of the founders of the Mix Network Bibliography.

* [How to detect TCP injection attacks](https://github.com/david415/HoneyBadger_docs/blob/master/source/how-to-detect-TCP-injection-attacks.rst)

In 2014-2015 shortly after the Edward Snowden document leaks I conducted research into TCP injection attacks. This document expounds upon my comprehensive classification of TCP injection attacks and is a result of my work on [Honeybadger](https://github.com/david415/honeybadger) which is known as the most sophisticated TCP injection attack detection tool ever written.
