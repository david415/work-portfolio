## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/images/david_hill_avatar.jpg" >}}

I am an independent security researcher, public speaker and software
developer. I started my career as a network tools developer and
operations engineer. I worked for Internet service providers and
software companies, automating systems and network operations. Shortly
after the Edward Snowden document leaks I transitioned my career into
a security specialist role. I was keenly interested in computer
security, especially network forensics, cryptography, and anonymous
communication networks. I took on many research and [software
development projects](/projects/) in my free time in order to further
my expertise such as [Honeybadger](https://github.com/david415/honeybadger/) a software
project I started in 2014 considered to be the most sophisticated
analyzer for detecting TCP injection attacks.

Starting in 2017 I worked on the European Commission funded grant
project known as the [Horizon 2020 Panoramix Project](https://panoramix-project.eu/).
During this time I collaborated with some of the top European academic
researchers to design and implement the [Katzenpost](https://github.com/katzenpost/) mix network, a
message oriented anonymous communication network.  While working on
Katzenpost I enjoyed giving [many public talks](/publicspeaking/) at security and privacy
conferences around Europe to explain mix networks and anonymous communication.

The work presented in this portfolio has everything to do with my
personal interests and basically nothing to do with the proprietary
software I've written for commercial companies. Please see my
[résumé](/david_stainton.pdf) for more about my work history.
